How to install my_wallet locally on your android phone:

I found a cool app on android that allows your android phone to become a web server
with this you can have a secure static copy of my_wallet installed on your own android phone
that can be used to serve your phones browser or any computer system that is on the same wifi system that
your phone connects to at that time or even on on wan if your setup port forwarding on your network.

To install first install Paw on your android phone: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.fun2code.android.pawserver&hl=en

Then clone a copy of my_wallet from github: https://github.com/sacarlson/sacarlson.github.io/tree/master/my_wallet
onto your computer that will later be used to interface to your android phone to copy the files to it.

hookup your computer to your android with usb or other method to move files to your android phone.  I found wifi file transfer app
works for this also if usb file transfer is not an option.

locate the directory /paw/html  on one of your sdcard0 or sdcard1 with the android phone

Rename the file /paw/html/index.xhtml to index2.xhtml to disable the default web app within Paw

Copy all the files from the my_wallet directory accept screen_shoots and wallet_screenshoots to your phones sd card at:
/paw/html.  Make sure to keep the relitive position of the subdirs /js and others within my_wallet in the same location with the same files in them.

optionaly you might also want to now delete my_wallet index.html and rename index_embeded.html to index.html that has all javascripts offline (no CDN)
within the phone and has all javascripts setup with integrity check for added security.

now you can start up the Paw application on your android phone.  it will display the ip address and port that now points to my_wallet

You can now bring up a browser on the phone or on any computer on that local network to bring up your private copy of my_wallet.  

example when I start Paw it displays 192.168.1.10:8080  so I can enter http://192.168.1.10:8080 on my computer that is on the same wifi network
to bring up my_wallet web app.
